     ><p>I look forward to the upcoming modules in the Thinkful web 
      development boot camp. I am new to coding and web development, but I am
      starting to feel more comfortable with the coding concepts and programming
      languages. I realize that I will be working with other developers in the 
      future when we work on other projects. Clear communication and teamwork will 
      be vital in us reaching our full potential as developers.</p>
